title: A Vanilla Non-Fungible Token Standard
description: NFTs for representing abstract ownership such as rights

## Abstract
In this standard, a non-fungible token stands as atomic existence and encourages
layers of abstraction built on top of it. Ideal for representing concepts like
rights, a form of abstract ownership. Such right, especially on-chain right,
can then be made liquid because of this tokenization.

## Motivation
Non-fungible tokens are popularized by the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) NFT standard
for representing "ownership over digital or physical assets". Over the course of
development, reputable NFT projects are mostly in these areas. The proposed
standard aims to single out a different type of NFTs that are not necessarily
representing such ownership of external contents via `URI`, but rather for
representing abstract rather than concrete ownership such as rights. Examples
include the right of making a function call to a smart contract, or the prepaid
membership (time-dependent right) of accessing to data feeds provided by oracles
without having to pay the required token fees. An on-chain subscription business
model can then be made available by this standard. Note, the motivation is not
to make a technical improvement, but rather to make a distinction for better
conceptual clarity.

## Specification
```
interface IERC3754 {
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved);

    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) external view returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) external;
}
```

## Rationale
If the NFTs defined in the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard are largely accepted
and known as representing ownership of concrete assets, in this standard, the
NFTs aim to be accepted and known as representing abstract ownership by
allowing layers of abstract utilities built on top of them. Ownership of such
NFTs is equivalent with having the rights to perform functions assigned to such
tokens. Since these rights are tokenized, transfer of such rights are made
easier. To distinguish this standard from [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), data fields
and functions related to `URI` are excluded.

## Backwards Compatibility
There is no further backwards compatibility required.

## Security Considerations
The security is enhanced from ERC721, given tokens are minted without having to
provide `URI`s. Errors in dealing with `URI`s can be avoided.
